# Hardware QA

## Session lifecycle

- Start and end a practice session 10 times.
- Confirm no duplicate microphone streams remain.
- Confirm no duplicate HUD callbacks remain.
- Confirm pause and resume do not multiply timers.
- Confirm ending a session clears active cue state.

## Audio source separation

- With `G2 Mic` selected, Phone Mic must not open.
- With `Phone Mic` selected, G2 PCM is not required.
- If G2 Mic fails, the app must ask the user to select Phone Mic instead of switching silently.

## Metrics to capture

- G2 mic success rate
- Phone fallback rate
- False silence detection rate
- Missed speech rate
- Cue p50 latency
- Cue p95 latency
- Crash count
- Reconnect count
- Battery consumption

## User test measures

- Time to first utterance
- Cue usage rate
- Cue dismissal rate
- False cue rate
- Phone checks during conversation
- Eye-contact breaks
- Interruption rating from 1 to 7
- Trust rating from 1 to 7
- Privacy concern from 1 to 7
